(d)
Branching allows you to have an environment to create new ideas. It allows for peer review before committing a file.

(e)
git log lets a user see commits to a repository and git status lets you see files that have been staged.

(f)

git status

(g)
git log --all --grep='file'

(h)
Encapsulation is:
Binding the data with the code that manipulates it.
It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference

Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.
It supports the concept of hierarchical classification.

Polymorphism means to process objects differently based on their data type.

(i)

the difference between them is who can push to the repository. In integration, everyone can push. In dictator, only one can push.

(j)
A dictator and lieutenants is better because there would be too much confusion if 100 people were pushing and pulling at once.

(5)

the game used polymorphism because multiple class interact with each other such as weapon and weapon factory.
